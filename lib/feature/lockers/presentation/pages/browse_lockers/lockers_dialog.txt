How can I fetch the data of buildings and remove duplicates:

// But change the lockers to a real fetching such as BlocBuilders
final lockers = response['data'] as List;

final Map<int, Map<String, dynamic>> uniqueBuildings = {};

for (var locker in lockers) {
  final building = locker['building'];
  uniqueBuildings[building['id']] = building;
}

final buildingsList = uniqueBuildings.values.toList();
